					<h3>'My Experience With Studying' - Harry</h3>
					<p>Studying information you like is great but when its something your not really interested in, it's hard to stay focused.<br> Over the course of my academic career studying hasn't been my main thing but just like everyone else,  I've learned to adapt and do what works for me.</p>

					<p>I believe that studying is important because it helps individuals acquire knowledge, develop critical thinking skills, and improve their understanding of the world around them. Studying also provides individuals with the opportunity to learn new things and expand their horizons, which can lead to personal growth and success in various areas of life.</p>
